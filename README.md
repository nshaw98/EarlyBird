# EarlyBird
#FlightChallenge - For this project, we had to create a feature that Twitter could potentially add to their application. The feature we created was named #Me, and it is a section in your profile that describes who you are on Twitter based on the hashtags you use. For example, if you talk about dogs and you use the hashtag "#dogs" frequently in your tweets, our feature will generate a list of your most frequently used hashtags so people could learn more about the type of things you like to discuss on Twitter. Due to time-constraints we couldn't expand on this feature's potential, such as using ML and being able to generate hashtags or data about the topics you discuss with or without using hashtags. Without hashtags we would use an algorithm that could select frequently used words in your tweets and be able to generalize what your tweets are about.
